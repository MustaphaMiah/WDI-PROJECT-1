# WDI PROJECT - 1
This is my first project from my Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.

My project is based on the infamous casino game, Roulette.

Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel. 

It is an unhealthily addictive game, with many arguing whether it's luck or stratergy. 

Some people argue whether the house fixes the wheel? 

I am pretty sure it's purely random, well atleast my game isn't bias.
