# WDI PROJECT - 1
This is my first project from my Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.

My project is based on a the famous casino game, Roulette.

It is a rather addictive game with generations arguing whether its luck vs stratergy. Whether the house fixes the wheel? 

I am pretty sure it's pure random, well atleasy my game isn't bias.
